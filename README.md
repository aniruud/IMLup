## IMLup

This repo contains some files and codes used by Anirudh Sharma for his masters thesis 'Modelling the dust distribution in the protoplanetary disk IMLup'.

Disk_setup.ipynb - Sets up the physical structure of the disk and the image calcuation in the mm continuum

Vertical_tests_plots.ipynb - Carries out and compares different vertical setups. The image calculation in the scattered light is also discussed

logprob_parallel.py -  Function which calculates the logprob value of a given set of parameters after comparison with observations

MCMC_parallelized.py - Carries out the MCMC simulation to sample the parameter space. Gives sampler.pickle as output

The most recent copy of the thesis is also present
